# ⚠️ DEPLOYMENT REMINDER

## CRITICAL: Always Prompt for Confirmation

**NEVER auto-approve Quick site deployments!**

When deploying to Quick sites, ALWAYS:
1. Prompt the user for Y/N confirmation before overwriting
2. Show which site will be overwritten
3. Let the user explicitly approve the deployment

### Correct Pattern:
```bash
# Prompt user
read -p "Do you want to proceed? (y/N): " -n 1 -r
if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    exit 1
fi

# Then deploy (let quick CLI handle its own prompts)
quick deploy dist/public spi-analysis
```

### Wrong Pattern (DO NOT USE):
```bash
# ❌ NEVER do this - auto-approves without user confirmation
echo "y" | quick deploy dist/public spi-analysis
```

### Current Deployment Target:
- **Site:** spi-analysis.quick.shopify.io
- **Script:** auto-deploy-dkt.sh
- **Subdomain:** spi-analysis (NOT god-mode)
